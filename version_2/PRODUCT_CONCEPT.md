# Narvo Product Concept: Version 2

## The Broadcast Paradigm
Version 2 shifts from static news reading to a dynamic "Broadcast" experience. The goal is to make news consumption effortless—primarily through high-quality audio that feels like a professional radio or TV bulletin.

## 1. Primary Presentation: Audio-First
- **Structure**: News stories are paraphrased into a narrative flow (e.g., Intro → Body → Significance).
- **Consumption**: Users primarily "listen" to the news, with text available as a secondary reference.
- **Style**: Mirroring the authoritative and clear tone of international broadcasting houses (e.g., BBC, NPR).

## 2. Summarization & Paraphrasing
- **Beyond Basics**: Instead of mere condensation, AI paraphrases content into "Stories."
- **Story Arc**: Each news item contains a "Headline," a "Summary (Paraphrased)," and "Key Takeaways."
- **Language**: Technical yet accessible language, focusing on clarity and impact.

## 3. User Experience Flows
- **Morning Briefing**: A curated audio reel of the top 5 stories delivered at a scheduled time.
- **The Broadcast Loop**: A continuous, radio-like stream that cycles top stories with high-priority "Breaking News" interruptions, ideal for background listening.
- **Multi-tier Localization**: A "Regional Zoom" feature allowing users to toggle between **City** (Hyper-local), **National**, and **Continental** news levels.
- **On-Demand Reading**: Compact text cards for quick scanning when audio isn't feasible.

## 4. Concept Goals
- **Minimize Clutter**: Access news in 2 taps or less.
- **Paraphrase Transparency**: Users can view a "Truth Tag" detailing how the AI synthesized the story, building trust through editorial openness.
- **Hands-Free Focus**: Fully navigable via voice or simple gesture controls for commuting or multitasking.
