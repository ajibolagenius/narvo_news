# Narvo Version 2: Overview

## Mission
Narvo Version 2 redefines news consumption by merging extreme minimalism with high-fidelity audio delivery. We transform fragmented information into a streamlined, technical, and professional broadcast experience.

## Core Pillars

- **The 10% Rule**: Visual design focuses on minimalism, reserving primary color for critical actions only.
- **Audio-First Delivery**: Primary consumption format is high-quality AI-generated audio, mirroring traditional TV/radio broadcasts.
- **Precision Engineering**: A Swiss grid layout system ensures structural clarity and technical sophistication.
- **Unified Ecosystem**: A monorepo architecture serves both mobile and web platforms with shared logic.

## Key Shifts from Version 1

| Feature | Version 1 | Version 2 (Refined) |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Design** | Bento-style, warm tones | Swiss grid, "Anti-light" backgrounds, 10% Color rule |
| **Primary Format** | Text-first with audio option | Audio-first (Broadcast style) with text backup |
| **Infrastructure** | Separate apps, Standard AI | Monorepo, Advanced AI (Gemini/OpenAI), Vector DBs |
| **Logic** | Summarization | Summarization + Paraphrasing (Storytelling) |

## Strategy
Narvo Version 2 moves beyond simple aggregation. It acts as an intelligent editor that takes news from diverse sources and paraphrases them into a cohesive, professional "broadcast" format, delivered via state-of-the-art speech synthesis.
