# Narvo Pages & Screens

## Design Paradigm: The High-Fidelity News Console
Following the Swiss Grid principle, every page is treated as a high-fidelity **news broadcast panel**. Layouts are strictly segmented by 1px borders to ensure journalistic order. Interaction is optimized for both desktop (editorial precision) and mobile (broadcast consumption).
