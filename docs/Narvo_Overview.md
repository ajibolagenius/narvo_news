# Narvo Overview

Narvo is a precision-engineered news broadcast platform that transforms fragmented information into high-fidelity, audio-enhanced narrative stories. Built for global audiences with a primary focus on African markets, it leverages advanced AI to deliver trustworthy broadcasts in authentic local voices.

## Mission
To democratize access to high-quality, trustworthy news by stripping away bloat and delivering content through a professional, **audio-first broadcast experience**—summarized, paraphrased, and **translated into the user's native language**.

## Core Pillars
- **Strict Minimalism**: The "Swiss Grid" architectural language (10% signal rule).
- **Broadcast-Grade Audio**: High-fidelity, narrative-driven delivery in the user's preferred local language.
- **Linguistic Inclusivity**: Real-time translation into native tongues (e.g., Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo) to break literacy and language barriers.
- **Trusted Authority**: Integrated Dubawa fact-checking and transparent "Truth Tag" paraphrasing.
- **Engineering Excellence**: A unified Monorepo ensuring cross-platform consistency.

## Strategic Narrative: "The Local Pulse, Refined"
Narvo bridges the gap between the vibrancy of local African news and the technical precision of global engineering. We don't just "show" news; we process it into a narrative experience that respects the user's time and intelligence.

## Shift from Version 1
- **Design**: Transitioned from "Bento" to a rigid, technical Swiss Matrix.
- **Content**: Moved from simple summarization to narrative "Broadcast Stories."
- **Technology**: Adopted a Monorepo with Google Gemini, Vector DBs (RAG), and premium TTS (ElevenLabs).
