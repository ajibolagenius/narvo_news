# Narvo Landing Page Strategy

## Overview

Landing page strategy incorporating a PWA-first approach and African-centric branding (with a focus on Nigeria). The goal is to create an inclusive, engaging experience that emphasizes empowerment, simplicity, and accessibility.

## Landing Page Layout

1. **Hero Section (Top Banner)** – Immediately communicates Narvo's value proposition with a bold headline, a concise subheading, and a prominent call-to-action. Visual style here should reflect the vibrant, local-inspired branding.
2. **Key Benefits Section (Why Narvo?)** – Highlights Narvo's core benefits in three pillars: **Empowerment**, **Simplicity**, **Accessibility**. Uses short paragraphs or icons with captions to convey each point.
3. **How It Works Section** – A simple step-by-step explanation (in 3 quick steps) of using Narvo, reinforcing the no-download PWA experience and ease of use.
4. **African Identity & Trust Section** – Conveys Narvo's cultural resonance and inclusivity. Copy here emphasizes that Narvo is built *by* and *for* African users (starting with Nigeria), with design elements inspired by local culture.
5. **Call-To-Action Footer** – Reiterates the primary CTA in a final encouragement to start using Narvo. Could also include a subtle prompt that Narvo works instantly in the browser (no installation needed), and perhaps a note like "Proudly crafted in Nigeria" to reinforce authenticity.
