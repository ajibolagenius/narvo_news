# Narvo Product Concept

## 1. The Broadcast Paradigm
Narvo is not a traditional news aggregator. It is a **Broadcast Entity**. We transform raw, fragmented data into professional, high-fidelity narrative bulletins.

## 2. Core Pillars
- **Audio-First Consumption**: Designed to be heard, then seen.
- **Broadcast-Style Paraphrasing**: AI recasts news into concise, professionally edited stories rather than simple "summaries."
- **Technical Minimalism**: A UI that feels like a precision instrument (Swiss Grid).

## 3. User Experience Flows
- **Morning Briefing**: A curated audio reel of the top 5 stories delivered at a scheduled time.
- **The Broadcast Loop**: A continuous, radio-like stream that cycles top stories with high-priority "Breaking News" interruptions.
- **Multi-tier Localization**: A "Regional Zoom" feature allowing users to toggle between **City** (Hyper-local), **National**, and **Continental** news levels.
- **On-Demand Reading**: Compact text cards for quick scanning.

## 4. Concept Goals
- **Minimize Clutter**: Access news in 2 taps or less.
- **Paraphrase Transparency**: Users can view a "Truth Tag" detailing how the AI synthesized the story.
- **Hands-Free Focus**: Fully navigable via voice or simple gesture controls.
