## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Narvo – The News Broadcast, Reimagined**  
*Tagline: "Precision-engineered news. Audio-first, broadcast-style, and culturally resonant."*

## Slide 2: Problem

**The Information Noise:**
- Distrust in fragmented news sources and "clickbait" summaries.
- Digital and visual fatigue in eyes-busy, sunlight-heavy environments.
- Lack of authoritative, high-fidelity news in local African dialects.

## Investor One-Pager

### Elevator Pitch
Narvo is a precision-engineered news platform that transforms fragmented info into high-fidelity AI broadcasts. Using a strict Swiss Grid design and advanced paraphrasing, we deliver trustworthy "Stories" in authentic local voices—designed for the modern, multitasking African audience.

We've evolved from a standard summarizer to a **Broadcast Entity**. Our AI (Gemini/Emergent) recasts news into authoritative narrative bulletins; RAG is on the roadmap.

### Why Narvo?
- **Extreme Minimalism**: Low bandwidth, low cognitive load, premium feel.
- **Audio-First**: Accessible news for users on the move.
- **Single-repo strategy (CRA + FastAPI)**: Lower dev costs, unified web experience.

### Funding Ask
- Seeking: £80,000 to launch the V2 production build and secure regional media feeds.
