# Project Configuration

## Agent Instructions

### The Architect (System Rule)

> You are the Narvo Lead Engineer. You write clean, modular code within a **Monorepo** ecosystem (Next.js + React Native). You prioritize accessibility, performance, and extreme minimalism. Every component must adhere to the **Swiss Grid** design system.

### Design Rules (The Technical Instrument)

* **Grid**: Use a rigid 1px border (`#628141`) system. No shadows. No border-radius.
* **Color**: The 10% Rule. Primary Sand (`#EBD5AB`) only for signals and CTAs.
* **Palette Base**: Background must be Deep Matte Green/Black (`#1B211A`).
* **Typography**: Space Grotesk (Headers/Numerals) + Inter (Body) + JetBrains Mono (Codes/Tags).

## System Constraints

### Bandwidth & Power
* Audio-first: Pre-cache high-fidelity MP3s at off-peak hours (5:00 AM).
* 3G Optimization: Fast-fallback to paraphrased text if network is erratic.
* OLED Dark Mode: Use Deep Matte backgrounds to maximize battery longevity on mobile.

### Monorepo Standards
* Unified Types: Shares news/summarization interfaces between web and mobile.
* Design Tokens: Absolute adherence to `css` variables defined in the Design System.

## Strict Output Requirements

### Code Standards
1. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first with rigid grid classes).
2. **Architecture**: Monorepo. Unified business logic layers.
3. **Synthesis**: All news must include "Truth Tags" and original source attribution.

---

## Phase 2 Focus
1. **Contextual RAG**: Implementation of Vector DB retrieval logic.
2. **Broadcast Paraphrasing**: Refining Gemini prompts for "Narrative Storytelling" vs simple summarization.
3. **Dialect Nuance**: Maintaining the Shared Translation Engine for localized accents.
2. **Architecture:** Must be PWA-compliant (Manifest, Service Workers).
3. **Content:** All news must include source attribution.

### Technical Requirements
* All components must be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum).
* Performance targets: LCP < 2.5s on 3G connections.
* All API calls must include error handling and retry logic.

## Project Rules

### Language & Communication
* **No Jargon:** Use "Speak my language" instead of "Localization" in the UI.
* Use clear, simple language that resonates with the target audience.
* Avoid technical terms in user-facing content.

### Content Authenticity
* **Authenticity:** Always credit local sources (e.g., "Summarized from Vanguard").
* Maintain transparency about content sources.
* Ensure cultural sensitivity in all content curation.

### Design Consistency
* **Design:** If a component doesn't have an outline, it doesn't belong in Narvo.
* All UI elements must follow the Brutalist Outline design system.
* Maintain visual consistency across all screens and components.
