<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** The user wants to build a full-stack, monorepo application called Narvo. Narvo is a precision-engineered, audio-first news broadcast platform designed for global audiences, with a primary focus on African markets.

The user's most recent request was multi-faceted, including urgent bug fixes and several new features:
**Urgent Bugs:**
1.  The NewsData.io integration is not retrieving articles.
2.  The global search function is not returning results from aggregator sources.

**New Features:**
1.  Connect the user's saved aggregator preferences (from the settings page) to the main dashboard feed, so the feed automatically filters based on those preferences.
2.  Implement deduplication to prevent the same story from appearing from both an RSS feed and a news aggregator.
3.  Add a clean, compact, yet comprehensive tour guide modal for first-time users.
4.  Integrate cinematic audio effects using Tone.js or Howler.js, particularly for news briefings.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a comprehensive audio-first news platform with a service-oriented backend (FastAPI) and a React frontend. It features a dashboard, discover page, and system settings. Core functionalities include RSS and programmatic news aggregation (Mediastack, NewsData.io), dynamic translation and text-to-speech (TTS) for news broadcasts, real-time feed health monitoring, and a voice preview feature. The agent has just completed writing the code to address two urgent bugs and implement four new features as per the user's request.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was working on a large, multi-part task that included fixing two critical bugs and implementing four new features.
        - **Bugs Fixed:**
            1. **NewsData.io:** Diagnosed that the API was returning an HTTP 422 error because the free plan limit () was being exceeded. The agent fixed this in  by reducing the request limit.
            2. **Aggregator Search:** Rewrote the global search endpoint () in  to correctly query all content sources, including RSS feeds, podcasts, and both news aggregators.
        - **Features Implemented:**
            1. **User Prefs → Dashboard:** The dashboard now fetches and respects the user's saved aggregator preferences.
            2. **Deduplication:** The backend now performs a title-based check to avoid showing duplicate articles from RSS and aggregators.
            3. **Tour Guide Modal:** Created  and integrated it into  to show on first visit.
            4. **Cinematic Audio:** Installed  and  and created a  service to play audio effects, which was integrated into the main .
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? both
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  No outstanding issues are known. The two urgent bugs reported by the user have been addressed in the code, but are awaiting verification.

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1: Verify the implementation of recent bug fixes and features (P0)
     - Where to resume: The code for all fixes and features has been written. The next step is to start the application, perform a visual check of the new UI elements (Tour Guide Modal), and then invoke the  to conduct a thorough regression test and validate all new functionalities (NewsData.io fetching, comprehensive search, user preference connection, deduplication, and cinematic audio).
     - What will be achieved with this? This will confirm that the two critical bugs are resolved and the four new features are working correctly without introducing any regressions.
     - Status: IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? both
     - Blocked on something: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
- **P1:** Add backend unit/integration tests for the new services, specifically for the TTS and podcast services.

**Future Tasks:**
- **P2:** Implement a native mobile application based on the provided performance guidelines.
- **P2:** Allow users to provide their own API keys for services like Mediastack if they choose.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Bug Fix (NewsData.io):** Corrected the API request limit in  to align with the free plan's constraints, resolving the data fetching issue.
- **Bug Fix (Search):** Rewrote the global search endpoint () in  to be comprehensive, aggregating results from RSS feeds, podcasts, and both news aggregators.
- **Feature (Connect User Prefs):** The  endpoint and the  were updated to ensure the main feed respects the user's saved aggregator source preferences.
- **Feature (Deduplication):** Implemented title-based deduplication logic in  to reduce content redundancy in the news feed.
- **Feature (Tour Guide Modal):** Created a new component at  and integrated it into  to display for first-time visitors.
- **Feature (Cinematic Audio):** Installed  and  and created a new service at  to manage and play audio effects, integrating it into the main .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **API Rate Limiting:** The debugging process involved identifying and fixing an issue caused by exceeding an external API's free-tier usage limits.
- **Comprehensive Search Aggregation:** The backend search endpoint was refactored to query multiple disparate data sources (RSS, podcasts, multiple aggregator APIs) and return a unified set of results.
- **Content Deduplication:** A title-similarity check was implemented to prevent redundant articles from appearing in the user's feed.
- **First-Visit UI Pattern:**  is used to track whether a user has seen the tour guide before, ensuring it only appears once.
- **Web Audio API Integration:** Third-party libraries (, ) were integrated into the React application to create and trigger cinematic sound effects programmatically.

**key DB schema**
  - No changes to the database schema were made in this session.

**changes in tech stack**
  - **New Frontend Dependencies:** ,  were added to .

**All files of reference**
- **New Files Created:**
  - : The UI component for the new user tour.
  - : A service to encapsulate audio effects logic using Tone.js/Howler.js.
- **Key Files Updated:**
  - : Fixed NewsData.io fetch limit and added deduplication logic.
  - : Overhauled the  endpoint to be comprehensive and updated  to accept user preferences.
  - : Added a  function to support the global search.
  - : Updated to fetch user preferences and pass them to the news API.
  - : Integrated the new tour guide modal to show on first visit.
  - : Integrated the cinematic audio service.
  - : Added  and  dependencies.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- While a robust backend test suite exists, it lacks coverage for the newly added  service and the  component on the frontend.

**key api endpoints**
- : Significantly overhauled to perform a comprehensive search across RSS feeds, podcasts, and aggregator articles.
- : Updated to accept query parameters (, ) to filter the feed based on user preferences.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The code for two urgent bug fixes and four new features has been written but is **unverified**. Your first priority is to run the application and conduct thorough testing.
- The NewsData.io API has a strict free plan limit of 10 articles per request. This is now hardcoded in . Be mindful of this if making future changes.
- The tour guide modal relies on a  key () to control its visibility.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-  (updated).
- Numerous backend test reports were generated during development, with the last successful full run being before the latest batch of features was added.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages** 
1. **User (Urgent Request):** Reported that NewsData.io is not fetching articles and that search doesn't include aggregator results. Also requested several new features: connecting user prefs to the dashboard, deduplication, a tour guide modal, and cinematic audio. (Status: Implementation code written, pending verification).
2. **Agent:** Proposed a plan to fix bugs and implement features.
3. **User:** Approved the plan.
4. **Agent:** Started implementation.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** The NewsData.io and search features were broken but are believed to be fixed. The fix is pending verification.
- **Mocked:** The fact-checking service () still contains placeholder logic for non-Google APIs.
- **Untested:** The newly implemented features (Tour Guide Modal, Cinematic Audio, User Prefs connection, Deduplication) and the bug fixes are not yet verified.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **New Frontend Libraries:**
    - : For generating synthesized sounds.
    - : A robust audio library for the web.

    - Google Fact Check API
    - Google Gemini (via Emergent LLM Key)
    - OpenAI TTS (via Emergent LLM Key)
    - Supabase (Authentication)
    - MongoDB (Database)
    - Mediastack API
    - NewsData.io API
