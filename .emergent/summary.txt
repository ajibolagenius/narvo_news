N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Database & Auth:** Supabase
- **AI & Services:**
    - **News Source:** RSS Feeds
    - **AI Paraphrasing:** Google Gemini (via Emergent LLM Key)
    - **Text-to-Speech:** OpenAI TTS (via Emergent LLM Key)

**key DB schema**
No explicit database schemas have been defined in code. The application relies on Supabase, and the backend uses Pydantic models for API request/response validation, not for database table definitions.

**changes in tech stack**
- The Text-to-Speech (TTS) provider was switched from **ElevenLabs** to **OpenAI TTS** due to API key issues with the former.

**All files of reference**
- : Contains all backend logic, including API endpoints, RSS fetching, and integrations with AI/TTS services.
- : A large, monolithic file containing the entire React application's UI and logic for all pages. **This file was just overwritten.**
- : Contains all global styles, keyframe animations, and CSS variables for the application. **This file is currently being edited.**
- : Defines the theme (colors, fonts) for the Tailwind CSS framework, recently updated to match the new design system.
- : The Product Requirements Document, maintained by the agent.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
The entire frontend is contained within a single file, . This is a significant source of technical debt. It desperately needs to be broken down into a proper component-based architecture with separate files for each page and component, using a router like  to handle navigation.

**key api endpoints**
- : Checks the health of the backend service.
- : Fetches the latest news items from RSS feeds.
- : Generates audio from text using OpenAI TTS.
- : Generates the Morning Briefing digest.
- : Lists available TTS voices.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The project has just pivoted to a new, more detailed UI design. You must follow the provided HTML files (, , ) exactly.
- The immediate task is to finish the CSS for the new UI components in .
- The most critical piece of technical debt is the monolithic  file. After completing the current UI task, your highest priority should be to refactor the frontend into a proper component-based structure.

**Credentials to test flow:**
The agent has been provided with and is using the necessary credentials for Supabase and the Emergent LLM Key.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent has not forgotten to execute any specific user requests. However, it has prioritized rapid implementation over code quality, leading to the creation of a monolithic  file. It did not proactively refactor this file, which is a significant architectural oversight that needs to be addressed.</analysis>
